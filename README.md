# Password Generator

## Overview

For this week’s challenge I have created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. The app has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password generator allows the user to generate a password when the button is clicked based on a selected length of characters, uppercase, lowercase, containing numbers and special characters.
